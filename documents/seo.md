SEO Knowledge

I learned a lot about SEO and what steps can be followed to optimize my web content to be competitive within search engines.

First, at the base of everything is creating relevant and compelling content that draws individuals to the website while having your website set up in a way that is accessible to crawlers. Crawling web content is how search engines determine if your content is relevant to a query and how your content will rank. Ideally, you rank as high as possible, as only a very small amount of users bother to go to page two of Google. Therefore, you want the content on your site to be as relevant as possible and you can target certain keywords in order to increase your chances of ranking in a query. So strategically picking keywords and using them throughout the site is an important aspect of SEO.  

In order to aid in this crawling, you want your site to have clear organization and hierarchy. It can be difficult for crawlers to find certain pages if they are orphaned or not relevant. However, on the other end, you want to ensure your content is not too similar or you can compete against yourself.  

The functionality of the site can also impact SEO. For example, slow load times can hurt SEO ranking, as can other UX issues. If the search engine doesn't view your site as functional, it is less likely to rank you highly.

All of this shows how important understanding SEO is, as it is incredibly important for the success of a site on the web.


Ideal Car Safe Kids SEO Plan
I would have multiple steps, focused on content and code updates, in my SEO strategy to increase the ranking and visibility of my site.

Content-wise, I would start with consulting various sites to determine what keywords I should be targeting in order in increase our chances of showing up in organic search queries. For example, 'car seat safety' would most likely be a strong non-brand keyword that I would want to target. Therefore, I'd make sure the meta title, meta description and URL are utilizing this language, as well as sprinkling it throughout my content.

In addition, I would want to have strategic linking throughout the site. As the site gets bigger, I would want to utilize internal linking between pages to ensure there aren't any orphaned pages and allow for crawlers to find each page. External links would also be beneficial to the site's overall SEO ranking, and I'd want to link out to other relevant content that users find interesting when appropriate. Ideally, I would be linked to by other relevant sources as well. In the future, I'd also want to adjust my API so that it was pulling in more relevant content, potentially after gaining approval to access car seat specific APIs.

As the site gets bigger, I'd want to potentially want to create HTML and XML sitemaps so that each page can be easily found by users and crawlers, even if not linked to in the primary navigation.

However, at the very core would just be ensuring the content itself is compelling.

From a code perspective, I would ensure that I only have one H1 tag per page so that crawlers can determine the content hierarchy. As mentioned above, I'd ensure each page has clear and concise meta information. I would want to include share options so that my site can be shared easily and given more visibility across the web.

I would attempt to keep the site well organized in the code and do what is possible to reduce load time. For example, compressing heavy images so that the page loads faster.  

All of these are the steps I would take to improve the site's overall SEO.
