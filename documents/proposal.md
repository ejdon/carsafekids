Safe Ride News

My course project will be a website for Car Safe Kids, an organization that contracts with area hospitals to conduct child passenger safety events so that certified experts can help new or expecting families learn how to install car seats correctly into their cars. 9 out of 10 car seats are installed incorrectly, so these events hope to maximize vehicle safety for kids throughout the community.

The site will feature a schedule for visitors and staff to gain key details on each event. It will also feature helpful tips and resources, an informational section about the company, and hopefully a form for questions or comments.

Ideally, I want to use an API for the schedule/calendar that returns event information, updates, tips, etc., similar to this site: https://mrproductreviews.com/review/child-seat-inspection-locations-in-wa/#seattle.

My hope is to use the NHTSA Child Safety Seat Inspection Station Locator (https://one.nhtsa.gov/webapi/Default.aspx?CSSIStations/API/80) or use something like a Google calendar API to pull the event information from the company's Google calendar.

If that is not within scope, using an API to make calls to various governmental resources would also be incredibly helpful, as it could act as a hub for visitors to find that information.

I want to build this site because this is an issue that I am passionate about. Currently, there is no website hosting this content, so my hope is to create a site the allows more people to easily find this important information. This felt like a great opportunity to develop a website to display this content to keep families and the community as safe as possible.
